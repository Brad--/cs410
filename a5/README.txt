How to compile program:
    make
How to execute program:
    ./raytracer <scenefile> <outfile name>

Notes:
    The .obj model I used is an avocado cut in half! I know it looks kind of weird, since the 'skin' is super bumpy and the 'flesh' is smooth, and my raytracer doesn't really do it justice, but it is in fact rendering the right model, it just looks a bit whack with only one material.
